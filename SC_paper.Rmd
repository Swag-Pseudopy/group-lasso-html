title: "Group Lasso with `grpreg` Package"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook demonstrating the implementation of the **group lasso** using the `grpreg` package. The group lasso is a regularization method for regression with grouped predictors, where sparsity is encouraged at the group level.

## **1. Install and Load the `grpreg` Package**

First, we install and load the `grpreg` package, which provides functions for fitting group lasso models.

```{r install-load-package}
# Install the grpreg package if not already installed
if (!require('grpreg')) {
  install.packages('grpreg')
}

# Load the grpreg package
library(grpreg)
```

---

## **2. Simulate Data**

We simulate a dataset with grouped predictors. The response variable `y` is generated as a linear combination of the predictors `X` with some added noise.

```{r simulate-data}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of observations
n <- 100

# Number of predictors
p <- 10

# Predictor matrix (random normal data)
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)

# Group structure (5 groups of size 2 each)
groups <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5)

# True coefficients (only groups 1 and 3 are active)
beta <- c(2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)

# Response variable (linear combination of predictors + noise)
y <- X %*% beta + rnorm(n)
```

---

## **3. Fit the Group Lasso Model**

We fit the group lasso model using the `grpreg` function. The `group` argument specifies the group structure, and the `penalty` argument specifies the group lasso penalty.

```{r fit-model}
# Fit the group lasso model
fit <- grpreg(X, y, group = groups, penalty = "grLasso")

# Display a summary of the model
summary(fit)
```

---

## **4. Visualize the Solution Path**

The solution path shows how the coefficients change as the regularization parameter \( \lambda \) varies. Groups are either included or excluded as \( \lambda \) decreases.

```{r plot-solution-path}
# Plot the solution path
plot(fit)
```

---

## **5. Perform Cross-Validation**

We use cross-validation to select the optimal value of the regularization parameter \( \lambda \). The `cv.grpreg` function performs cross-validation and returns the optimal \( \lambda \).

```{r cross-validation}
# Perform cross-validation
cvfit <- cv.grpreg(X, y, group = groups, penalty = "grLasso")

# Plot the cross-validation results
plot(cvfit)
```

---

## **6. Extract the Optimal Model**

The optimal \( \lambda \) value and the corresponding coefficients are extracted from the cross-validation results.

```{r optimal-model}
# Optimal lambda value
lambda_min <- cvfit$lambda.min
cat("Optimal lambda:", lambda_min, "\n")

# Coefficients at the optimal lambda
optimal_coef <- coef(cvfit)
print(optimal_coef)
```

---

## **7. Interpretation of Results**

- **Solution Path:** The plot shows how the coefficients change with \( \lambda \). Groups are either included or excluded as \( \lambda \) varies.
- **Cross-Validation:** The plot of cross-validation results helps identify the optimal \( \lambda \) that minimizes prediction error.
- **Optimal Model:** The coefficients at the optimal \( \lambda \) indicate which groups are selected as important predictors.

## **8. Save the Results (Optional)**

The results (e.g., coefficients, optimal lambda) to a file for future reference.

```{r logging}
# Assign column names to the predictor matrix X
colnames(X) <- paste0("X", 1:p)  # Assign names like X1, X2, ..., X10

# Save the results to a CSV file
write.csv(data.frame(
  Predictor = colnames(X),  # Use the assigned column names
  Coefficient = optimal_coef[-1],  # Exclude intercept
  Lambda = lambda_min,
  Group = groups
), file = "group_lasso_results.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
